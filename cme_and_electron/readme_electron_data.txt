- Each row contains electron and proton properties at each timestamp
- Timestamps are approximately 5 minutes apart
- Time range is from December 1995 to January 2002
- Columns:
	- time - str, current timestamp
	- electron - float, natural log of electron flux from >0.25 MeV channel
	- electron_high - float, natural log of electron flux from >0.67 MeV channel
	- proton - float, natural log of proton flux from >10 MeV channel
	- background - int, 1 if current timestamp is not during an SEP event, 0 otherwise
	- rising - int, 1 if current timestamp is between the onset and peak of an SEP event, 0 otherwise
	- falling - int, 1 if current timestamp is between the peak and end of an SEP event, 0 otherwise
